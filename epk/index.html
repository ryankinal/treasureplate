					<h2>Band Biography</h2>

					<p>There's a new light blinking on the panel in front of you. This is your moment! You've been searching the sky for signs of life as long as you can remember, waiting for that silent red pulse. It's a message from space! A ship from the future! It's call-sign... Treasure Plate!?! You push the receiver button. A tape reel spins and on the screen in front of you, four intrepid space people and their faithful AI power up their engines to jump into hyperspace.</p>

					<p>Treasure Plate is a sci-fi themed rock opera which blends catchy, hook-fueled rock and roll with a synthy, psychedelic flair. More than solid songs, Treasure Plate tells stories from the lives of her crew; a far flung future where working stiffs have adventures as they fly around the galaxy. When they're not putting in a day's work or fending off tentacled monsters, they broadcast their music across space and time.</p>

					<p>The crew formed in 2017, as singer-songwriters Brian McCormick and Ryan Kinal (Gasolene Genes) conspired to blend their love of music, theater and visual art into something unprecedented in Western New York. They recruited Joshua Lowenberger (Glitch, Ice Cream Social, Kung Fu Grip) on drums and the indomitable Luke Cornwell (Seth Faergolzia's Multibird, &quot;Look, Bees!&quot;) on synth/keys.</p>

					<p>Treasure Plate shows are more than &quot;sets&quot;. Their first show, Engine Core Phenomenal, follows the crew through a wrong turn on a routine mission, putting them face to face with terrors from the stars and within. It's a sometimes inspiring, sometimes thoughtful, sometimes downright creepy exploration of the varied influences the crew has to offer, and will leave you howling for more. The band has just finished translating Engine Core Phenomenal into an album at Jesse Sprinkle's (Poor Old Lu, Demon Hunter, Morellaâ€™s Forest) Bluebrick Records Recording Studio and will be releasing on November 8th at Rochester NY's Kaleidoscope Collective.</p>
